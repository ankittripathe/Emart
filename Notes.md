# Understanding Relative vs. Absolute Paths in React Router
# (1) Relative Path (./product/${props.id})
A relative path means it will be resolved based on the current route.
If you're on /mens, it would try to navigate to /mens/product/${props.id} instead of /product/${props.id}, which is incorrect in your case.

# (2) Absolute Path (/product/${props.id})
An absolute path always starts from the root (/).
No matter where the user is (e.g., /mens, /womens, /kids), it will always navigate to /product/${props.id}, which is the correct URL structure for your app.


#
 [productId]: prev[productId] + 1
This updates the specific product's quantity.
prev[productId] gives the current quantity of the product.
prev[productId] + 1 increments it by 1.
The new object { ...prev, [productId]: prev[productId] + 1 } is returned.

🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
setCartItems is a state updater function

It updates the cartItems state (assuming you initialized it with useState({})).
Using the Previous State (prevCart)

React's useState setter function (setCartItems) allows updating state using a function:
js
Copy
Edit
setCartItems((prevCart) => { ... });
This ensures that updates are based on the latest state.
Creating a New Object ({ ...prevCart, [itemId]: prevCart[itemId] + 1 })

{ ...prevCart } → Spreads all previous cart items into a new object.
[itemId]: prevCart[itemId] + 1 → Updates the quantity of the given itemId.
Potential Issue:

If prevCart[itemId] is undefined (when adding an item for the first time),
undefined + 1 results in NaN.
✅ Fix the Issue
You should use default value (|| 0) to handle the case when prevCart[itemId] is undefined:

js
Copy
Edit
const addToCart = (itemId) => {
  setCartItems((prevCart) => ({
    ...prevCart,
    [itemId]: (prevCart[itemId] || 0) + 1, // Ensures first-time addition starts from 1
  }));
};
🎯 Final Working Explanation
✅ If the item is already in the cart (prevCart[itemId] exists), it increases the quantity by 1.
✅ If the item is not in the cart (prevCart[itemId] is undefined), it starts from 0 + 1 = 1.
✅ React ensures a new state object is created instead of mutating the existing one.
Now, your addToCart function works perfectly! 🚀
